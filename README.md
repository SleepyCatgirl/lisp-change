# lisp-change
Friend wanted me to give some assignemnt a try.
# What does it do
It asks for input, a number, two times, and returns a change based on that.
Basically very simple change calculator.
# Why is it bad
I did it the lazy way.
Later might poke a more proper way to do this.
I am also bad at everything.
